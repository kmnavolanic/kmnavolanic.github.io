Setting Up the Game:
Define the range within which the random number will be generated. 
Use the Random function to generate a random integer within the specified range. 
ranNum = Random(101)
This will give you a random number between 0 and 100.

User Interaction:
Prompt the user to input their guess.
Compare their guess with the randomly generated number.
Feedback:
If the user’s guess is equal to the random number, its a correct guess
If the guess is too high, provide feedback “Your guess is too high."
If the guess is too low, say something “Your guess is too low."

Looping:
Add the option to keep the game going regardless of the provided guess
