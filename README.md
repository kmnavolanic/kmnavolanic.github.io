# About Me
## My Interests
  I have interests that fall into gaming and new experiences. I attempt to try anything once and have used this mentality to travel to all 50 states and have allowed myself to experience thrilling events like deep sea diving   and black diamond mountain skiing.
## Games I recomend
  [Total War Warhammer Page] (https://www.totalwar.com/games/warhammer/)  -  I enjoy grand strategy games as well as real time strategy games the most out of all the genres. Total war mixes both subtypes into one game and has a rich lore to accompany it.
  [Mass Effect Game Page] (https://www.ea.com/games/mass-effect/mass-effect-legendary-edition)  -  Mass effect was the first RPG that grabbed my attention and held it for the subsequent sequels. It has a rich universe full of lore and adventure for   
  the player to discover.
